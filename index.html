                        Thesis: Shakespeare uses several different characters to depict different views of honor, <br> 
                        and by showing these different views, Shakespeare shows that honor is ultimately useless <br>
                        and that one's idea of honor simply reflects one's character.

                        If all the year were playing holidays,<br>
                        To sport would be as tedious as to work;<br>
